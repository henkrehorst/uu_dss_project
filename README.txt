Data Collection and Preparation
	route_crowdForecast.py
	Retrieves the crowd forecast from the NS API for the required route and returns the color for each forecasted level (low, medium, high).

	rail_routes.py
	Retrieves the geoJSON data from the NS API for the given stations in the get_rail_routes_lines function.

	ndw_request_filters.py
	Retrieves road works and other road cloasure data from the NDW Melvin API 

	ns_get_location.py
	Retrieves list of locations closest to given lat/lng from NS API, cleans the data to make it ready for db storage.

Data Sources
	1. NS (Nederlandse Spoorwegen) API - https://gateway.apiportal.ns.nl
	2. NDW (Nationale Databank Wegverkeersgegevens) Melvin API - https://melvin.ndw.nu/melvinservice/rest/public/all

	* Unfortunately, the ProRail API is not as accessible as we thought so we decided to move away from that.

Existing Indicators and Visualizations
	1. Map of busiest rail routes with crowd indicators
		The map shows the busiest rail routes in the Netherlands, with the color of the route representing the forecasted crowdness.
		Supported CSF: Accurate forecasting of passenger demand during infrastructure maintenance
		Data source: NS API
		Generated by rail_routes.py
	2. List of busiest rail routes
		To the right of the map, there is a list of the most occupied rail routes in the Netherlands. This will become interactive in the final version.
		Supported CSF: Accurate forecasting of passenger demand during infrastructure maintenance
		Data source: NS API
		Generated by rail_routes.py
	3. Other components
		The other components are just placeholders for now, as we are yet to plot the data for that.
